# Eye Detector App

A simple AI project using Python and OpenCV that detects eyes in real-time through a webcam.

## Features

- Real-time eye detection
- Uses Haar cascade classifiers from OpenCV
- Works with live webcam feed

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV

## How It Works

This project uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascade model to detect eyes in each frame from the webcam feed. When the app is run, it opens a camera window and draws rectangles around the eyes it detects.
